# Annotation-tool

This is a simple annotation tool which was used to label images for later use during a machine learning project.

It takes the images located in `data/unlabeled` and after labeling moves the image + the label to `data/labeled`. This was my first javasctript/html work so the code is little spaghetti-ish but it does the job.

**To run**

Install the php pacakge and simply run `php -S localhost:8000`. Now open your browser and go to `localhost:8000`.
